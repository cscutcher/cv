\section{\bf{ Personal } }
My passion for electronics, computing and just about anything to do with 
technology, started at a young age. 
I took apart and reconstructed anything that beeped or whirred to see how it
worked. 
Today, I remain insatiably curious about all aspects of technology. 

From 2004 to 2005 I worked with Structuretone PLC, as a temporary IT 
Co-ordinator and In house Developer. 
My duties entailed working with both their Head Office and International Clients, 
planning, setting up and maintaining essential systems. 
This has also given me experience and an insight into how technology is put to 
use in a business environment outside a strictly engineering environment and its
potential problems. 

In the summer of 2007 I was employed in the set-top-box department at NXP 
researching, developing and implementing a replacement testing GUI aimed at both
engineers and potential clients. 
This was particularly useful experience for one of my main interests, embedded 
computing, and also helped develop my C/C++ skill, also furthering my experience 
of innovative GUI design.

I complete MEng Computer Engineering in July 2010. 
This degree has given me extensive theoretical and practical knowledge over a 
uniquely wide range of topics covering high level software design to low level 
digital design and test. 
It has also allowed me to get involved with interesting technological niches 
such as evolutionary algorithms, bioinspired engineering and formal validation.

From 2008 to 2009 I took a gap year to work in industry at Critical Software 
Technologies Ltd where I had a chance to concentrate on the development of 
safety critical certified software and its verification. 
This has given me unique experience of highly reliable and robust software that
is developed on-budget and on-time. 
During my time at Critical Software I had experience with common software
safety standards such as the DO-178B and its application in development. 
I was also lucky enough to gain significant experience in independant validation
and verification using LDRA. 

Although in my work I often use Windows based software, I have a preference towards
Linux and the open source movement and prefer to use it in development.

My main areas of interest are embedded, pervasive computing, biologically 
inspired engineering, stigmergy and emergence. 
I enjoy solving problems in new and innovative ways, and often look to design and
experiment with new ideas in my own time.

Outside of work I enjoy seeing an eclectic array of live music. In the past I 
have volunteered for Anti-Slavery International working at the bars at Reading 
Festival which was an exciting experience, very different from my usual work.
I also have an interest in philosophy, reading and foreign film.
